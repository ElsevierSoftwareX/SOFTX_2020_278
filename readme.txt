rheed++

rheed++ is a software framework for computer simulation of RHEED intensity oscillations 
during the growth of thin epitaxial films. The calculations are based on the one-beam approximation. 
The software consists of two computational models: growth++ and rheed++, and 
does not require linking to any of the existing numerical library routines.
